This is a series where I'll be detailing some of my thoughts and processes with development of my game engine (and possibly game). The source for the in-development engine can be found here: [https://github.com/ScrimpyCat/Blob-Game](https://github.com/ScrimpyCat/Blob-Game). There isn't going to be a set frequency or order for these posts.

The engine is written in C and will support Mac OS X/Linux/Windows and possibly iOS.
